## Greetings Berlin concertgoers!

We'll have a game for everyone after the first band plays.

But do you wanna play a game NOW?

Gather four friends (or strangers) to play STAY IN TOUCH. You can play it any time tonight.

1. First, [download the mp3 file](events/lights-out/stay-in-touch.mp3). 
2. Gather as four players, put the mp3 file on each phone, put on headphones
3. FInally, find a seat or a stool outside, and press play at the exact same time.

Yrs,

--THE DRUIDS
