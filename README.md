## Greetings Potsdam concertgoers!

We'll have a game for everyone after the first band plays.

But if you can gather together four friends (or strangers) we have a game for you RIGHT NOW. It's called STAY IN TOUCH.

1. First, [download the mp3 file](events/lights-out/stay-in-touch.mp3). 
2. You'll need to gather a group of four players, put the mp3 file on each phone, 
3. FInally, find Curious Joe and he'll take you to a good spot to play.

Yrs,

--THE DRUIDS
